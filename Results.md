The results of the RNA-Seq analysis reveal distinct transcriptional shifts in Candida albicans under thiamine-deprived conditions. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot demonstrates clear clustering of biological replicates, with samples from thiamine-present (TH+) and thiamine-absent (TH-) conditions grouping separately along the first principal component, which explains 88% of the variance. This separation highlights the consistency of the data and the significant transcriptional changes associated with thiamine availability. The distinct clustering of TH- samples reflects the activation of specific pathways to adapt to nutrient stress, emphasizing the biological relevance of the differentially expressed genes.

The volcano plot further supports these findings, highlighting genes with both significant fold changes and statistical significance. Genes such as THI20 and THI6, critical for thiamine biosynthesis, are prominently upregulated and appear in the upper-right quadrant, with high log2 fold changes and low adjusted p-values. These genes represent key components of the organism's adaptive response to thiamine starvation. The absence of significant downregulation in the upper-left quadrant indicates that the primary transcriptional response under TH- conditions is upregulation of genes necessary for survival and nutrient acquisition.

The significant gene expression table corroborates these findings, identifying THI20 (log2 fold change: 4.45, adjusted p-value: 1.12e-82) and THI6 (log2 fold change: 4.68, adjusted p-value: 3.36e-119) as major contributors to thiamine biosynthesis pathways. Other upregulated genes include SNZ1 and SNO1, which are involved in pyridoxine metabolism and stationary-phase adaptation, further supporting the organism's ability to endure nutrient-limited environments. Collectively, these results highlight the robust transcriptional response of C. albicans to thiamine deprivation, showcasing its ability to upregulate critical biosynthetic pathways to maintain cellular function and resilience under stress conditions.
