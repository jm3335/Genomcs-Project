Quality control is a critical step in RNA-Seq data processing, ensuring high-quality data for accurate downstream analyses. This experiment involved three key stages of QC: initial quality assessment, trimming, and post-trimming evaluation, conducted on paired-end files (WTB2_1.fq.gz and WTB2_2.fq.gz).

The initial FastQC analysis revealed quality issues in both files, with per-base sequence content being concering as well Per sequence GC content. These findings indicated a need for trimming to improve data reliability. Trimmomatic was thus used to address these quality issues with specific parameters: ILLUMINACLIP removed TruSeq adapter sequences, HEADCROP:15 eliminated the first 15 bases prone to sequencing errors, TRAILING:20 and SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 dynamically trimmed regions with low average quality scores, and MINLEN:75 ensured only reads of sufficient length were retained. The trimming results showed high retention rates, with 95.69% of read pairs kept as high-quality forward and reverse pairs, while only 0.64% were dropped. The Script utilized for this step is titled "TrimmomaticScript.SBATCH."

After this, a second FastQC analysis was performed on the trimmed files (WTB2_1.trPE.fq.gz and WTB2_2.trPE.fq.gz). This analysis confirmed substantial improvements: Per base sequence content was improved as well as Per sequence GC content. However, the concerns regarding Sequence Duplication Levels was not resolved as the second fastQC analysis still displayed concering levels of sequence duplication.
