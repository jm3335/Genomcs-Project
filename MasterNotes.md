In this bioinformatics workflow, we aim to analyze gene expression changes under two experimental conditions: Thi+ (cells grown in the presence of thiamine) and Thi- (cells grown in the absence of thiamine). The sequence data is structured into paired-end FASTQ files for each treatment condition, allowing for analysis of expression differences across multiple replicates. For the Thi+ treatment, the files include WTA1_1.fq.gz, WTA1_2.fq.gz, WTB1_1.fq.gz, WTB1_2.fq.gz, WTC1_1.fq.gz, and WTC1_2.fq.gz. For the Thi- treatment, the sequence data is provided in WTA2_1.fq.gz, WTA2_2.fq.gz, WTB2_1.fq.gz, WTB2_2.fq.gz, WTC2_1.fq.gz, and WTC2_2.fq.gz.

We begin the workflow with quality control (QC) using FastQC to generate a quality report for each sequence file, helping to identify any issues with base quality, adapter contamination, or base composition. Following this, we use Trimmomatic to trim adapters, low-quality regions, and filter out short reads, ensuring high-quality data for downstream analysis. Once QC is complete, the reads are aligned to a reference genome using Bowtie2, producing .sam or .bam files that capture the alignment data needed for gene expression quantification.

The next step involves counting the number of reads aligning to each gene model using HTSeq, generating a count matrix that serves as the foundation for differential expression analysis. We then analyze these counts in R using DESeq2, identifying genes that are significantly up- or downregulated between the Thi+ and Thi- conditions. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is performed on the differentially expressed genes, providing insight into the biological processes affected by thiamine availability. This comprehensive workflow—from quality control to gene ontology analysis—enables a thorough investigation of how thiamine presence influences gene expression profiles.

Quality control is a critical step in RNA-Seq data processing, ensuring high-quality data for accurate downstream analyses. This experiment involved three key stages of QC: initial quality assessment, trimming, and post-trimming evaluation, conducted on paired-end files (WTB2_1.fq.gz and WTB2_2.fq.gz).

The initial FastQC analysis revealed quality issues in both files, with per-base sequence content being concering as well Per sequence GC content. These findings indicated a need for trimming to improve data reliability. Trimmomatic was thus used to address these quality issues with specific parameters: ILLUMINACLIP removed TruSeq adapter sequences, HEADCROP:15 eliminated the first 15 bases prone to sequencing errors, TRAILING:20 and SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 dynamically trimmed regions with low average quality scores, and MINLEN:75 ensured only reads of sufficient length were retained. The trimming results showed high retention rates, with 95.69% of read pairs kept as high-quality forward and reverse pairs, while only 0.64% were dropped. The Script utilized for this step is titled "TrimmomaticScript.SBATCH."

After this, a second FastQC analysis was performed on the trimmed files (WTB2_1.trPE.fq.gz and WTB2_2.trPE.fq.gz). This analysis confirmed substantial improvements: Per base sequence content was improved as well as Per sequence GC content. However, the concerns regarding Sequence Duplication Levels was not resolved as the second fastQC analysis still displayed concering levels of sequence duplication.
