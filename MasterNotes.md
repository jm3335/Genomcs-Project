In this bioinformatics workflow, we aim to analyze gene expression changes under two experimental conditions: Thi+ (cells grown in the presence of thiamine) and Thi- (cells grown in the absence of thiamine). The sequence data is structured into paired-end FASTQ files for each treatment condition, allowing for analysis of expression differences across multiple replicates. For the Thi+ treatment, the files include WTA1_1.fq.gz, WTA1_2.fq.gz, WTB1_1.fq.gz, WTB1_2.fq.gz, WTC1_1.fq.gz, and WTC1_2.fq.gz. For the Thi- treatment, the sequence data is provided in WTA2_1.fq.gz, WTA2_2.fq.gz, WTB2_1.fq.gz, WTB2_2.fq.gz, WTC2_1.fq.gz, and WTC2_2.fq.gz.

We begin the workflow with quality control (QC) using FastQC to generate a quality report for each sequence file, helping to identify any issues with base quality, adapter contamination, or base composition. Following this, we use Trimmomatic to trim adapters, low-quality regions, and filter out short reads, ensuring high-quality data for downstream analysis. Once QC is complete, the reads are aligned to a reference genome using Bowtie2, producing .sam or .bam files that capture the alignment data needed for gene expression quantification.

The next step involves counting the number of reads aligning to each gene model using HTSeq, generating a count matrix that serves as the foundation for differential expression analysis. We then analyze these counts in R using DESeq2, identifying genes that are significantly up- or downregulated between the Thi+ and Thi- conditions. Finally, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is performed on the differentially expressed genes, providing insight into the biological processes affected by thiamine availability. This comprehensive workflow—from quality control to gene ontology analysis—enables a thorough investigation of how thiamine presence influences gene expression profiles.

Quality Control:

Quality control is a critical step in RNA-Seq data processing, ensuring high-quality data for accurate downstream analyses. This experiment involved three key stages of QC: initial quality assessment, trimming, and post-trimming evaluation, conducted on paired-end files (WTB2_1.fq.gz and WTB2_2.fq.gz).

The initial FastQC analysis revealed quality issues in both files, with per-base sequence content being concering as well Per sequence GC content. These findings indicated a need for trimming to improve data reliability. Trimmomatic was thus used to address these quality issues with specific parameters: ILLUMINACLIP removed TruSeq adapter sequences, HEADCROP:15 eliminated the first 15 bases prone to sequencing errors, TRAILING:20 and SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 dynamically trimmed regions with low average quality scores, and MINLEN:75 ensured only reads of sufficient length were retained. The trimming results showed high retention rates, with 95.69% of read pairs kept as high-quality forward and reverse pairs, while only 0.64% were dropped. The Script utilized for this step is titled "TrimmomaticScript.SBATCH."

After this, a second FastQC analysis was performed on the trimmed files (WTB2_1.trPE.fq.gz and WTB2_2.trPE.fq.gz). This analysis confirmed substantial improvements: Per base sequence content was improved as well as Per sequence GC content. However, the concerns regarding Sequence Duplication Levels was not resolved as the second fastQC analysis still displayed concering levels of sequence duplication.

Sequencing and Allignment:

To map sequencing reads to a reference genome, we used the Candida albicans SC5314 genome assembly, which was obtained from the NCBI database (GCF_000182965.3). The reference genome file, in FASTA format, and the accompanying GTF annotation file were downloaded. The name of these files are titled GCF_000182965.3_ASM18296v3_genomic.fna and GCF_000182965.3_ASM18296v3_genomic.gtf respectively. The sequencing reads were aligned to this reference using Bowtie2, a widely used aligner suitable for mapping short reads to large genomes. Bowtie2 was employed to align the reads to the reference genome, generating output in SAM format. The SAM file contains detailed alignment information, including the position of each read relative to the reference, alignment quality, and associated metadata. The script utilized for the step is titled "bowtie2.sBATCH".

Here is the following output data from bowtie2: Loading bowtie2/2.5.3 Loading requirement: bcftools/1.20 samtools/1.20 19476343 reads; of these: 19476343 (100.00%) were paired; of these: 940835 (4.83%) aligned concordantly 0 times 17341774 (89.04%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time 1193734 (6.13%) aligned concordantly >1 times ---- 940835 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these: 348454 (37.04%) aligned discordantly 1 time ---- 592381 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these: 1184762 mates make up the pairs; of these: 735765 (62.10%) aligned 0 times 395227 (33.36%) aligned exactly 1 time 53770 (4.54%) aligned >1 times 98.11% overall alignment rate

HTseq and DESeq2 and GO:

HTSeq was employed to quantify reads aligned to gene features, utilizing a structured htseq-count script. The script titled "HTseqnew.sBATCH" incorporated variables for input BAM files, a GTF annotation file, and labeled output files, such as WT**_htseqCount, to organize results systematically. Key flags used in the command included -f bam to specify the input format, -r pos to process sorted reads, -s no to account for strand specificity, -t exon to focus on exon features, and -i gene_id to assign reads to genes accurately. This approach ensured robust and reliable assignment of sequencing reads to annotated gene features.

The resulting HTSeq count data were used as input for differential expression analysis using DESeq2 in R using the script titled "calb_DESeq_script_FINAL.R". This workflow involved multiple steps, starting with normalization of raw read counts to correct for differences in library size and compositional bias. Genes with fewer than 10 reads across all samples were filtered out to improve data quality. The analysis then established the thiamine-present condition as the reference to calculate fold changes, allowing the identification of genes that were significantly up- or downregulated under thiamine-absent conditions. Results were visualized through principal component analysis (PCA) plots, which provided insight into sample clustering, and volcano plots, which highlighted differentially expressed genes based on statistical significance and magnitude of expression changes. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes involved functional annotation using Gene Ontology. Enrichment analysis identified overrepresented GO terms within three main categories: Biological Process, which includes physiological pathways like the response to thiamine starvation; Molecular Function, which describes specific activities such as enzymatic or binding functions; and Cellular Component, which focuses on subcellular localization, such as ribosomes.
